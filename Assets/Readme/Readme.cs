/*
 * I hope the scripts in this library a somewhat self-explanatory.
 * Except for maybe the player controller, but fiddle around with that a bit and I think
 * you'll get it.
 * 
 * Some scripts use the free version of the DOTween library, which simplifies
 * lerping sprites, images, animations and more. You can get it in the package manager.
 * The paid version is NOT necessary. If you also do not want to use DOTween, you can
 * just delete all script line that contain *.DO*.
