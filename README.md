You can use this as a starting point for an Unity project using the Unity Version 2021.3.14f1, 
but should be easily adaptable to other versions, since it doesn't use anything fancy.

Otherwise, you can just pick and choose from the scripts in the asset folder, depending on your project's needs.
My project doesn't contain anything beyond the scripts for the moment.

Some scripts depend on the free DOTween Plugin and some scripts need the free Cinemachine plugin.
You can find both of them in the package manager, I think. Otherwise, the Unity Asset Store.
